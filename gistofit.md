## ðŸŽ— INTRODUCTORY SUMMARY:

- REGEX(Regular expression): Is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern.

I started this assignment by researching "Which regex is used the most?", I came across this article

<https://digitalfortress.tech/tips/top-15-commonly-used-regex/> and I chose "Complex password strength" because

I feel I would use that the most in the real world. I always like to do things a little differently and I like to think

outside the box. Therefore, I have created a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions 

by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does. A Complex Password Strength: Should have 1

lowercase letter, 1 uppercase letter, 1 number, 1 special character and be at least 8 characters long.  

``
/(?=(.*[0-9]))(?=.*[\!@#$%^&*()\\[\]{}\-_+=~`|:;"'<>,./?])(?=.*[a-z])(?=(.*[A-Z]))(?=(.*)).{8,}/
``

## ðŸŽ— REGEX COMPONENTS:

/(?=(.*[0-9]))(?=.*[\!@#$%^&*()\\[\]{}\-_+=~`|:;"'<>,./?])(?=.*[a-z])(?=(.*[A-Z]))(?=(.*)).{8,}/

### ðŸŽ— Anchors:

- Open: Indicates the start of a regular expression.

      `start '/' end of the string`

- Close: Indicates the end of a regular expression.

### ðŸŽ— Quantifiers:

- The {8,} which sets the length of the password minimum of 8 characters.

- There are five `.*` which is 0 or more, it is also called 'the wildcard' because it matches everything to preceding text.

- `.` Calls for any character.

### ðŸŽ— OR Operator:

- The OR operator acts as a boolean using the | symbol by matching the expression before or after the | symbol.

### ðŸŽ— Character Classes:

- The [A-Z] expression matches a character in the range from â€˜Aâ€™ to â€˜Zâ€™ which is case sensitive.

- The expression [a-z] will match from range of â€˜aâ€™ to â€˜zâ€™, case sensitive.

- [0-9]

### ðŸŽ— Flags:

- N/A

### ðŸŽ— Grouping and Capturing:

- Groups are represented by '()', Groups can have multiple expressions to create a capture group. `(?=(.*[0-9]))`

### ðŸŽ— Bracket Expressions:

- Bracket expressions are a list of characters enclosed by '[]' and will match any single character in that list.

- Bracket expressions are used in this example in combination with character classes.

``
[0-9], [\!@#$%^&*()\\[\], [a-z], [A-Z]
``

### ðŸŽ— Greedy and Lazy Match:

- The ? makes the preceding quantifier lazy, causing it to match as few characters as possible.

- The .* is used to match anything.

- `.` Is used to match any character.



### ðŸŽ— Boundaries:

- N/A

### ðŸŽ— Back-references:

- `\\` Are used to escape special characters.

### ðŸŽ— Look-ahead and Look-behind:

- There are five positive look-aheads. `?=` Look-aheads allow you to match groups before or 

after without including in your result.
